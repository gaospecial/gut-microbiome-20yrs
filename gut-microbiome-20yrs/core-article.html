<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.1</span> 如何确定核心文献？</h2>
<p>在最初阶段我们的分析依赖于全部的5万多篇文献，但是我们很快发现这个数据量在进行较复杂的分析时，一方面会导致计算量比较大，另一方面也没有必要完整覆盖。因此寻找一个方法确定核心文献十分必要。高被引论文虽然是一个备选，但是高被引论文针对的是大的学科领域，可能并不能凸显论文对道菌群研究的重要性。且我们也可以发现2009年前是没有高被引论文在这5万多篇文献中存在的，因此对于一些特别经典的菌群研究论文有所遗漏。因此我们使用<strong>本地被引频次</strong>这个参数对文献做了一定的筛选，即将每年本地被引频次排在前 5% 的文献作为关键文献，进行了更为充分的分析。</p>
<p>我们看一下本地被引频次的含义。
<strong>本地被引频次</strong>，即 Local Citation Score（LCS），它表示这篇文章在当前数据集中被引用的次数。
<strong>全局引用次数</strong>，即 Global Citation Score （GCS），它表示这篇文章被整个WOS数据库中所有文献引用的次数，也就是在 Web of Science 网站上看到的引用次数。
一篇文章GCS很高，说明被全球科学家关注较多。但是如果一篇GCS很高，而LCS很小，说明这种关注主要来自与你不是同一领域的科学家。此时，这篇文献对你的参考意义可能不大。如果 LCS 很高，则说明这篇文献与你数据集中关注的领域十分相关。所以，使用 LCS 可以快速定位一个领域的经典文献。</p>
<p>值得一提的是，我们按照 LCS 前 5% 筛选后得到的文献共有 2690 篇，其中覆盖了约三分之二的WoS高被引论文，比WoS高被引论文少了700多篇。不过，另外新增了约800多篇新文献（图 <a href="method.html#fig:HC-vs-MC">1.1</a>）。</p>
<p>图 <a href="core-article.html#fig:HC-vs-MC-year">B.1</a> 显示这些论文的差别主要在哪些年份。</p>
